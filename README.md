# work-day-scheduler

The goal of this project was to take existing HTML and CSS code and integrate Javascript to make a functioning daily task scheduler that can be updated, focusing on using Moment.js for dealing with date and time. 

As a user, when you open the daily planner to create a schedule you should be able to do/see the following:
-current date and time at the top of the calendar
-timeblocks for standard business hours
-timeblocks are color coded for past, present or future
-when clicking on a timeblock you can enter an event
-when clicking the save button for a specific timeblock the event is saved in local storage
-when the page is refreshed, the saved events persist
